Observations from Your Model and Training:

  Data Splits:
        You split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets using percentages (70%, 30%, 10%). However, this totals 110%, which seems incorrect. It should be adjusted to something like 70% for training, 20% for validation, and 10% for testing.

Model Architecture:
        The model is relatively simple, with a Flatten layer, followed by two dense layers (128 and 64 units), and a final output layer with a sigmoid activation function.
        Regularization is applied with l2 for one dense layer.
        You might benefit from adding dropout layers to reduce overfitting.
Compilation:
        The optimizer used is Adam with a learning rate of 0.01.
        Binary cross-entropy is the correct loss function for binary classification.
        The accuracy metric is appropriate.
        
        
        
Training Progress:
        Early epochs show high loss values, indicating some initial instability.
        The model eventually converges, achieving a training accuracy of 98.7% and validation accuracy of 98.4% in the last epoch.
        Validation loss is relatively low, suggesting good generalization, but periodic spikes in loss (e.g., epochs 36-38) could indicate some instability or overfitting.

 Suggestions for Improvement:
        Learning Rate Scheduling: Reduce the learning rate dynamically during training. You can use callbacks like ReduceLROnPlateau.
        Early Stopping: Introduce early stopping to avoid overfitting if validation performance stops improving.
        Data Augmentation: Apply data augmentation (e.g., flipping, rotation) to increase dataset diversity and improve robustness.
        Dropout Layers: Add dropout layers between dense layers for better regularization.
